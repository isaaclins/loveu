                        <p>
                            Thank you for existing, in the first place.
                            You make me feel full of life again. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I may not be the first boy to know you, but I would love to be the last one.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I want to make you feel safe, good, trusted, warm, cared for. 
I want to be your man, your best friend, your safe place, your boyfriend, your home, your personal cook, your helper, your shoulder to lean on, your emotional support, wiping your tears when needed and being there in the harsh times. 
I want you to call me whenever you’re happy, sad, moody, euphoric, on days that are monotone and days that are gleaming. 
It’s unfair that we share happy moments together but cry alone and I want to be there for you on every step of the way. 
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I want you to be able to be completely honest with me, no matter the situation. 
I want you to be able to tell me if I did something wrong and trust me, I'll make up for it. 
</p>
<p>
I know life isn't always perfect, yet in my eyes, you’ve captured the essence of perfection.
And there isn't a single thing I would change about you.
You are perfect in my eyes just the way you are.
I may have my difficulties expressing myself with you but I want you to know that I really do like you alot.
And I mean that in every way possible. 
</p>
<p>
    I'd have to start making up new words to describe how I see you because calling you beautiful just isn't enough.
</p>
<p>
You’re very brave and strong and you have an incredible and joyful soul.
Funny to think where we started and where we are now. 
</p>
<p>
Remember our first video-call? 
</p>
<p>
Neither of us wanted to say goodbye so I cooked my meal while I listened to your hilarious stories, talking to each other for five hours straight. 
And I personally think that's funny, because I'd do it again in every single universe there is.
</p>
<p>
I'd like to say, I have never truly experienced happiness until I met you as you make me feel whole again. 
With you every problem there is seems so insignificant and small. 
Im truly grateful for every second we spend together and really look towards a future where I get to tell you good morning and bring you
breakfast in bed. </p>
<p>
And I promise to never leave your side. 
</p>
<p>
Because I cherish everything about you.
</p>
<p>
Because your warmth makes hours feel like seconds.
</p>
<p>
Because a world without you would be cold. 
</p>
<p>
Because you brighten my day by just existing. 
</p>
<p>
Because your smile lights up rooms.
</p>
<p>
Because you're more than enough.
</p>
<p>
Because with you, the world is a better place.
</p>
<p>
Because every time I see you I get lost in your eyes.
</p>
<p>
Because your voice is mesmerizing, like that of a mermaid.
</p>
<p>
Because everytime I catch a scent of you when you're not around, I start looking for you, hoping I get to see you.
</p>
<p>
Because my heart aches on every goodbye.
</p>
<p>
Because I see us in every single love song.
</p>
<p>
Because with you, Mondays sounds fun.
</p>
<p>
Because my week consists of days I get to take you out and days I don’t.
</p>
<p>
Because I love you.
</p>
<p>
Together, I'd like to write our story, one sunset at a time.
</p>
<p>
<b>Always yours,</b> Isaac
